# Advent of Code 24

Solutions for the advent of code 2024 puzzles, implemented in Python. The
puzzles can be found here: https://adventofcode.com/2024

## Python

### Custom Key in Sorted

To use a `key` function that takes two arguments use `functools.cmp_to_key`
(see day 5).

```
import functools

def compare(a, b):
    return a - b

ordered = sorted(elements, key=functools.cmp_to_key(compare))
```

### Send Data to a Generator

It is possible to send data to a generator, see day 15.

### Create a Set from a List of Items

```
set().union(*items)
```

### Create a Set from an Iterable and Single Item

Do
```
nodes | {n}
```
which is equivalent to
```
set(iterable).union({item})
```

### Set Subset Operator

To check if all items in `first` is also in `second` use
```
first <= second
```
which is equivalent to
```
first.intersection(second) == first
```

## Algorithms

### Initial Min Value

Be careful not choosing a too small initial min value when trying to find the minimum of something. Use e.g.
`float("inf")` instead of `1e6`.

### Loop Detection

Keep track of the states in a visited set, if a state is already visited
there is a loop. The state must contain all necessary information, e.g.
position might not be enough we also need direction.

### Line Representations

There are many ways to represent a line. One example is by a point `(x, y)` and a vector `(u, v)`. Another example is
the general form `ax + by + c = 0`. Both if these avoids to potential division by zero that could be an issue with the
slope-intercept representation `y = m*x + b`. See https://www.sunshine2k.de/articles/algorithm/line2d/linerep2d.html
and day 8.

### Lanternfish

If there are several identical items that evolves over time a good approach is to keep a counter for each unique item
and in that way evolve all items of a certain kind simultaneously. See day 11.

### Detect Emerging Pattern in Random

Find the minimum entropy, a pattern should have smaller entropy than random. Day 14 is an example where this is kind of
used. A more general solution is probably to convert the grid to a string of letters and compute the entropy for this
string.

### Find All Shortest Paths

It is possible to modify Dijkstra to find all shortest paths, see day 16.

### Find Fully Connected Components

I invented an algorithm (may not be first, have not checked) for finding all fully connected
components (i.e. each node in the component is connected to all other nodes in the component). See
`find_fully_connected_components()` in day 23. The Bronâ€“Kerbosch algorithm can also be used.
